# HalloDoc Platform

Internship/Training Project

A health-care website offers online, Doctors consultation and Diagnostics services.

Doctors can conveniently access patient records, efficiently manage appointments, and securely communicate with their
patients.

Additionally, patients can utilize the website to request care for themselves or on behalf of others.

The platform accommodates three types of users: Admin, Physician, and Patients.

The Admin user has comprehensive access to patient and physician records, enabling them to review patient history, manage cases, and exercise control over requests by canceling or blocking them when necessary.
